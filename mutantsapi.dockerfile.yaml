#### Stage 1: Build the application
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine as build

  # Set the current working directory inside the image
WORKDIR /MutantsAPI

  # Copy maven executable to the image
#mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper
COPY mvnw .
COPY .mvn .mvn

  # Copy the pom.xml file
COPY pom.xml .

  # Build all the dependencies in preparation to go offline.
  # This is a separate step so the dependencies will be cached unless
  # the pom.xml file has changed.
RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline -B

  # Copy the project source
COPY src src

  # Package the application
RUN ./mvnw package -DskipTests
RUN mkdir -p target/dependency && (cd target/dependency; jar -xf ../*.jar)

  #### Stage 2: A minimal docker image with command to run the app
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine

ARG DEPENDENCY=/app/target/dependency

  # Copy project dependencies from the build stage
#COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/lib /MutantsAPI/lib
#COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/META-INF /MutantsAPI/META-INF
#COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/classes /MutantsAPI

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "MutantsAPI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war"]
